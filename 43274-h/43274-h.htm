<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Since the Middle Ages the Chinese have been almost
unanimous in regarding Li Po as their greatest poet, and
the few who have given the first place to his contemporary
Tu Fu have usually accorded the second to Li.</p>

<p>One is reluctant to disregard the verdict of a people upon
its own poets. We are sometimes told by Frenchmen or
Russians that Oscar Wilde is greater than Shakespeare.
We are tempted to reply that no foreigner can be qualified
to decide such a point.</p>

<p>Yet we do not in practice accept the judgment of other
nations upon their own literature. To most Germans
Schiller is still a great poet; but to the rest of Europe
hardly one at all.</p>

<p>It is consoling to discover that on some Germans
(Lilienkron, for example) Schiller makes precisely the
same impression as he does on us. And similarly, if we
cannot accept the current estimate of Li Po, we have at
least the satisfaction of knowing that some of China’s most
celebrated writers are on our side. About <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 816 the poet
Po Chü-i wrote as follows (he is discussing Tu Fu as well
as Li Po): “The world acclaims Li Po as its master poet.
I grant that his works show unparalleled talent and originality,
but not one in ten contains any moral reflection or
deeper meaning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tu Fu’s poems are very numerous; perhaps about 1,000
of them are worth preserving. In the art of stringing
together allusions ancient and modern and in the skill of his
versification in the regular metres he even excels Li Po.
But such poems as the ‘Pressgang,’<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and such lines as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘At the Palace Gate, the smell of wine and meat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out in the road, one who has frozen to death’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>form only a small proportion of his whole work.”</p>

<p>The poet Yüan Chēn (779-831) wrote a famous essay
comparing Li Po with Tu Fu.</p>

<p>“At this time,” he says (<i>i.e.</i>, at the time of Tu Fu), “Li
Po from Shantung was also celebrated for his remarkable
writings, and the names of these two were often coupled
together. In my judgment, as regards impassioned vigour
of style, freedom from conventional restraint, and skill in
the mere description of exterior things, his ballads and songs
are certainly worthy to rub shoulders with Fu. But in
disposition of the several parts of a poem, in carrying the
balance of rhyme and tone through a composition of several
hundred or even in some cases of a thousand words, in
grandeur of inspiration combined with harmonious rhythm
and deep feeling, in emphasis of parallel clauses, in exclusion
of the vulgar or modern&mdash;in all these qualities Li is
not worthy to approach Fu’s front hedge, let alone his
inner chamber!”</p>

<p>“Subsequent writers,” adds the “T’ang History” (the
work in which this essay is preserved), “have agreed with
Yüan Chēn.”</p>

<p>Wang An-shih (1021-1086), the great reformer of the
eleventh century, observes: “Li Po’s style is swift, yet
never careless; lively, yet never informal. But his intellectual
outlook was low and sordid. In nine poems out of
ten he deals with nothing but wine or women.”</p>

<p>In the “Yü Yin Ts’ung Hua,” Hu Tzŭ (<i>circa</i> 1120)
says: “Wang An-shih, in enumerating China’s four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
greatest poets, put Li Po fourth on the list. Many vulgar
people expressed surprise, but Wang replied: ‘The reason
why vulgar people find Li Po’s poetry congenial is that it is
easy to enjoy. His intellectual outlook was mean and
sordid, and out of ten poems nine deal with wine or
women; nevertheless, the abundance of his talent makes it
impossible to leave him out of account.’”</p>

<p>Finally Huang T’ing-chien (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1050-1110), accepted
by the Chinese as one of their greatest writers, says with
reference to Li’s poetry: “The quest for unusual expressions
is in itself a literary disease. It was, indeed, this
fashion which caused the decay which set in after the
Chien-an period (<i>i.e.</i>, at the beginning of the third century
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>).”</p>

<p>To these native strictures very little need be added.
No one who reads much of Li’s poetry in the original can
fail to notice the two defects which are emphasized by the
Sung critics. The long poems are often ill-constructed.
Where, for example, he wishes to convey an impression of
horror he is apt to exhaust himself in the first quatrain, and
the rest of the poem is a network of straggling repetitions.
Very few of these longer poems have been translated. The
second defect, his lack of variety, is one which would only
strike those who have read a large number of his poems.
Translators have naturally made their selections as varied
as possible, so that many of those who know the poet only
in translation might feel inclined to defend him on this
score. According to Wang An-shih, his two subjects are
wine and women. The second does not, of course, imply
love-poetry, but sentiments put into the mouths of deserted
wives and concubines. Such themes are always felt by the
Chinese to be in part allegorical, the deserted lady symbolizing
the minister whose counsels a wicked monarch will not
heed.</p>

<p>Such poems form the dullest section of Chinese poetry,
and are certainly frequent in Li’s works. But his most
monotonous feature is the mechanical recurrence of certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
reflections about the impermanence of human things, as
opposed to the immutability of Nature. Probably about
half the poems contain some reference to the fact that rivers
do not return to their sources, while man changes hour by
hour.</p>

<p>The obsession of impermanence has often been sublimated
into great mystic poetry. In Li Po it results only
in endless restatement of obvious facts.</p>

<p>It has, I think, been generally realized that his strength
lies not in the content, but in the form of his poetry.
Above all, he was a song-writer. Most of the pieces
translated previously and most of those I am going to read
to-day are songs, not poems. It is noteworthy that his
tombstone bore the inscription, “His skill lay in the
writing of archaic songs.” His immediate predecessors
had carried to the highest refinement the art of writing in
elaborate patterns of tone. In Li’s whole works there are
said to be only nine poems in the strict seven-character
metre. Most of his familiar short poems are in the old
style, which neglects the formal arrangement of tones.
The value of his poetry lay in beauty of words, not in
beauty of thought. Unfortunately no one either here or in
China can appreciate the music of his verse, for we do not
know how Chinese was pronounced in the eighth century.
Even to the modern Chinese, his poetry exists more for
the eye than for the ear.</p>

<p>The last point to which I shall refer is the extreme
allusiveness of his poems. This characteristic, common to
most Chinese poetry, is carried to an extreme point in the
fifty-nine Old Style poems with which the works begin.
Not only do they bristle with the names of historical
personages, but almost every phrase is borrowed from some
classic. One is tempted to quarrel with Wang An-shih’s
statement that people liked the poems because they were
easy to enjoy. No modern could understand them without
pages of commentary to each poem. But Chinese poetry,
with a few exceptions, has been written on this principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
since the Han dynasty; one poet alone, Po Chü-i, broke
through the restraints of pedantry, erasing every expression
that his charwoman could not understand.</p>

<p>Translators have naturally avoided the most allusive
poems and have omitted or generalized such allusions as
occurred. They have frequently failed to recognize allusions
as such, and have mistranslated them accordingly, often
turning proper names into romantic sentiments.</p>

<p>Li’s reputation, like all success, is due partly to accident.
After suffering a temporary eclipse during the Sung dynasty,
he came back into favour in the sixteenth century, when
most of the popular anthologies were made. These compilations
devote an inordinate space to his works, and he
has been held in corresponding esteem by a public whose
knowledge of poetry is chiefly confined to anthologies.</p>

<p>Serious literary criticism has been dead in China since
that time, and the valuations then made are still accepted.</p>

<p>Like Miss Havisham’s clock, which stopped at twenty
to nine on her wedding-day, the clock of Chinese esteem
stopped at Li Po centuries ago, and has stuck there ever
since.</p>

<p>But I venture to surmise that if a dozen representative
English poets could read Chinese poetry in the original, they
would none of them give either the first or second place to
Li Po.</p>


<h3>XXXI. 25.</h3>

<p class="title">LIFE OF LI PO, FROM THE “NEW HISTORY OF THE
T’ANG DYNASTY,” COMPOSED IN THE ELEVENTH
CENTURY.</p>

<p>Li Po, styled T’ai-po, was descended in the ninth generation
from the Emperor Hsing-shēng.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> One of his
ancestors was charged with a crime at the end of the Sui
dynasty,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and took refuge in Turkestan. At the beginning
of the period Shēn-lung<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the family returned and settled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Pa-hsi.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> At his birth Po’s mother dreamt of the planet
Ch’ang-kēng [Venus], and that was why he was called Po.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>At ten he had mastered the Book of Odes and Book
of History. When he grew up he retired to the Min
Mountains, and even when summoned to the provincial
examinations he made no response. When Su T’ing<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
became Governor of I-chou, he was introduced to Po, and
was astonished by him, remarking: “This man has conspicuous
natural talents. If he had more learning he would
be a second Ssŭ-ma Hsiang-ju.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> However, he was
interested in politics and fond of fencing, becoming one of
those knight-errants who care nothing for wealth and much
for almsgiving.</p>

<p>Once he stayed at Jēn-ch’ēng<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> with K’ung Ch’ao-fu,
Han Chun, P’ei Chēng, Chang Shu-ming, and T’ao Mien.
They lived on Mount Ch’u Lai, and were dead drunk
every day. People called them the Six Hermits of the
Bamboo Stream.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the T’ien-pao period<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> he went south
to Kuei-chi, and became intimate with Wu Yün. Wu Yün
was summoned by the Emperor, and Po went with him to
Ch’ang-an. Here he visited Ho Chih-chang. When Chih-chang
read some of his work, he sighed and said: “You are
an exiled fairy.” He told the Emperor, who sent for Po and
gave him audience in the Golden Bells Hall. The poet
submitted an essay dealing with current events. The
Emperor bestowed food upon him and stirred the soup with
his own hand. He ordered that he should be unofficially
attached to the Han Lin Academy, but Po went on drinking
in the market-place with his boon-companions.</p>

<p>Once when the Emperor was sitting in the Pavilion of
Aloes Wood, he had a sudden stirring of heart, and wanted
Po to write a song expressive of his mood. When Po<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
entered in obedience to the summons, he was so drunk that
the courtiers were obliged to dab his face with water.
When he had recovered a little, he seized a brush and
without any effort wrote a composition of flawless grace.</p>

<p>The Emperor was so pleased with Po’s talent that whenever
he was feasting or drinking he always had this poet to
wait upon him. Once when Po was drunk the Emperor
ordered [the eunuch] Kao Li-shih to take off Po’s shoes.
Li-shih, who thought such a task beneath him, took
revenge by affecting to discover in one of Po’s poems a
veiled attack on [the Emperor’s mistress] Yang
Kuei-fei.</p>

<p>Whenever the Emperor thought of giving the poet some
official rank, Kuei-fei intervened and dissuaded him.</p>

<p>Po himself, soon realizing that he was unsuited to Court
life, allowed his conduct to become more and more reckless
and unrestrained.</p>

<p>Together with his friends Ho Chih-chang, Li Shih-chih,
Chin, Prince of Ju-yang, Ts’ui Tsung-chih, Su Chin, Chang
Hsü, and Chiao Sui, he formed the association known as
the Eight Immortals of the Winecup.</p>

<p>He begged persistently to be allowed to retire from
Court. At last the Emperor gave him gold and sent him
away. Po roamed the country in every direction. Once
he went by boat with Ts’ui Tsung-chih from Pien-shih to
Nanking. He wore his embroidered Court cloak and sat
as proudly in the boat as though he were king of the universe.</p>

<p>When the An Lu-shan revolution broke out, he took
to living sometimes at Su-sung, sometimes on Mount
K’uang-lu.</p>

<p>Lin, Prince of Yung, gave him the post of assistant on
his staff. When Lin took up arms, he fled to P’ēng-tsē.
When Lin was defeated, Po was condemned to death.
When Po first visited T’ai-yüan Fu, he had seen and
admired Kuo Tzŭ-i.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> On one occasion, when Tzŭ-i was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
accused of breaking the law, Li Po had come to his
assistance and had him released.</p>

<p>Now, hearing of Po’s predicament, Tzŭ-i threatened to
resign unless Po were saved. The Emperor remitted the
sentence of death and changed it to one of perpetual exile at
Yeh-lang.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> But when the amnesty was declared he came
back to Kiukiang. Here he was put on trial and sent
to gaol. But it happened that Sung Jo-ssŭ was marching
to Honan with three thousand soldiers from Kiangsu. He
passed through Kiukiang on his way, and released the
prisoners there. He gave Li Po an appointment on his
staff. Po soon resigned.</p>

<p>When Li Yang-ping became Governor of T’ang-tu, Po
went to live near him.</p>

<p>The Emperor Tai Tsung<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> wished to raise him to the
rank of Senior Reviser. But when the order came Po was
already dead, having reached the age of somewhat over
sixty. His last years were devoted to the study of Taoism.</p>

<p>He once crossed the Bull Island Eddies and, reaching
Ku-shu, was delighted by a place called the Green Hill,
which lay in the estate of the Hsieh family. He expressed
a desire to be buried there, but when he died they buried
him at Tung-lin.</p>

<p>At the end of the period Yüan-ho,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Fan Ch’uan-chēng,
Governor of the districts Hsüan and Shē [in Anhui],
poured a libation on his grave and forbade the woodmen to
cut down the trees which grew there.</p>

<p>He sought for Li Po’s descendants, but could only
find two grand-daughters, who had both married common
peasants, but still retained an air of good breeding. They
appeared before the Governor weeping, and said: “Our
grandfather’s wish was to be buried on top of the Green
Hill. But they made his grave at the eastern hill-base,
which is not what he desired.”</p>

<p>Fan Ch’uan-chēng had the grave moved and set up two
tombstones. He told the ladies they might change their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
husbands and marry into the official classes, but they
refused, saying that they were pledged to isolation and
poverty and could not marry again. Fan was so moved
by their reply that he exempted their husbands from national
service. A rescript of the Emperor Wēn Tsung created
the category of the Three Paragons: Li Po, of poetry;
P’ei Min, of swordsmanship; and Chang Hsü, of cursive
calligraphy.</p>

<p>Most of the accounts of Li Po’s life which have hitherto
appeared are based on the biography given in vol. v. of the
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires Concernant Les Chinois</span>.” It is evident that
several of the frequently quoted anecdotes in the
“Mémoires” are partly based on a misunderstanding
of the Chinese text, partly due to the lively imagination of
the Jesuits. The Sung writer Hsieh Chung-yung arranged
in chronological order all the information about the poet’s
life that can be gleaned not only from the T’ang histories,
but also from the poems themselves.</p>

<p>In the communications of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesellschaft für Natur und
Völkerkunde</span>, 1889, Dr. Florenz makes some rather haphazard
and inaccurate selections from this chronology.</p>

<p>The Life in the “New T’ang History” has, I believe,
never before been translated in full. The Life in the
so-called “Old T’ang History” is shorter and contains
several mistakes. Thus Li is said to have been a native
of the Province Shantung, which is certainly untrue.</p>

<p>The following additional facts are based on statements in
the poet’s own works.</p>

<p>With regard to his marriage in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 730 he writes to a
friend: “The land of Ch’u has seven swamps; I went to
look at them. But at His Excellency Hsü’s house I was
offered the hand of his grand-daughter, and lingered there
during the frosts of three autumns.” He then seems to
have abandoned Miss Hsü, who was impatient at his lack
of promotion. He afterwards married successively Miss
Lin, Miss Lu, and Miss Sung. These were, of course,
wives, not concubines. We are told that he was fond of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
“going about with the dancing-girls of Chao-yang and
Chin-ling.” He had one son, who died in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 797.</p>

<p>With regard to his part in the revolution, the “New
History” seems somewhat confused. It is probable that
his sojourn in the prison at Kiukiang took place before and
not after his decree of banishment. It is also uncertain
whether he knew, when he entered the service of Lin, that
this prince was about to take up arms against the Emperor.
The Chinese have reproached Po with ingratitude to his
Imperial patron, but it would appear that he abandoned
Prince Lin as soon as the latter joined the revolution.</p>

<p>A mysterious figure mentioned in the poems is the
“High Priest of Pei-hai” [in Shantung], from whom the
poet received a diploma of Taoist proficiency in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 746.</p>

<p>Li Yang-ping gives the following account of Po’s death:
“When he was about to hang up his cap [an euphemism
for “dying”] Li Po was worried at the thought that his
numerous rough drafts had not been collected and arranged.
Lying on his pillow, he gave over to me all his documents,
that I might put them in order.”</p>

<p>The “Old T’ang History” says that his illness was due
to excessive drinking. There is nothing improbable in the
diagnosis. There is a legend<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> that he was drowned while
making a drunken effort to embrace the reflection of the
moon in the water. This account of his end has been
adopted by Giles and most other European writers, but
already in the twelfth century Hung Mai pointed out that
the story is inconsistent with Li Yang-ping’s authentic
evidence.</p>

<p>The truth may be that he contracted his last illness as
the result of falling into the water while drunk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE TEXT OF THE POEMS.</h3>

<p>The first edition of the poems was in ten <i>chüan</i>, and was
published by Li Yang-ping in the year of the poet’s death.
The preface tells us that Li Po had lost his own MSS. of
almost all the poems written during the eight years of his
wanderings&mdash;that is, from about 753 to 761. A few copies
had been procured from friends. About 770 Wei Hao
produced an edition of twenty <i>chüan</i>, many additional poems
having come to light in the interval.</p>

<p>In 998 Yo Shih added the prose works, consisting of five
letters and various prefaces, petitions, monumental inscriptions,
etc.</p>

<p>In 1080 Sung Min-ch’iu published the works in thirty
<i>chüan</i>, the form in which they still exist. There are just
under 1,000 poems and about sixty prose pieces.</p>

<p>In 1759 an annotated edition was published by Wang
Ch’i, with six <i>chüan</i> of critical and biographical matter
added to the thirty <i>chüan</i> of the works.</p>

<p>It is this edition which has been chiefly used by European
readers and to which references are made in the present
paper. It was reprinted by the Sao Yeh Co. of Shanghai
in 1908.</p>

<p>The text of the poems is remarkable for the number of
variant readings, which in some cases affect crucial words
in quite short poems, in others extend to a whole line or
couplet. A printed text of the thirteenth century containing
the annotations of Yang Tzŭ-chien is generally followed in
current editions. This is known as the Hsiao text; a
Ming reprint of it is sometimes met with.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the eighteenth century, a Sung
printed edition came into the hands of a Mr. Miu at
Soochow; he reprinted it in facsimile. This is known as
the Miu text. As there is no means of deciding which of
these two has the better authority, my choice of readings has
been guided by personal preference.</p>

<h3>III. 1. <span class="smcap">The Distant Parting</span></h3>

<p>Long ago there were two queens<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> called Huang and
Ying. And they stood on the shores of the Hsiao-hsiang,
to the south of Lake Tung-t’ing. Their sorrow
was deep as the waters of the Lake that go straight
down a thousand miles. Dark clouds blackened the sun.
Shōjō<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> howled in the mist and ghosts whistled in the rain.
The queens said, “Though we speak of it we cannot mend
it. High Heaven is secretly afraid to shine on our loyalty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
But the thunder crashes and bellows its anger, that while
Yao and Shun are here they should also be crowning Yü.
When a prince loses his servants, the dragon turns into a
minnow. When power goes to slaves, mice change to
tigers.</p>

<p>“Some say that Yao is shackled and hidden away, and
that Shun has died in the fields.</p>

<p>“But the Nine Hills of Deceit stand there in a row,
each like each; and which of them covers the lonely bones
of the Double-eyed One, our Master?”</p>

<p>So the royal ladies wept, standing amid yellow clouds.
Their tears followed the winds and waves, that never
return. And while they wept, they looked out into the
distance and saw the deep mountain of Tsang-wu.</p>

<p>“The mountain of Tsang-wu shall fall and the waters of
the Hsiang shall cease, sooner than the marks of our tears
shall fade from these bamboo-leaves.”</p>

<h3><a id="III_4"></a>III. 4. <span class="smcap">The Szechwan Road</span></h3>

<p>Eheu! How dangerous, how high! It would be easier
to climb to Heaven than to walk the Szechwan Road.</p>

<p>Since Ts’an Ts’ung and Yü Fu ruled the land, forty-eight
thousand years had gone by; and still no human
foot had passed from Shu to the frontiers of Ch’in. To
the west across T’ai-po Shan there was a bird-track, by
which one could cross to the ridge of O-mi. But the earth
of the hill crumbled and heroes<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> perished.</p>

<p>So afterwards they made sky ladders and hanging bridges.
Above, high beacons of rock that turn back the chariot of
the sun. Below, whirling eddies that meet the waves of
the current and drive them away. Even the wings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
yellow cranes cannot carry them across, and the monkeys
grow weary of such climbing.</p>

<p>How the road curls in the pass of Green Mud!</p>

<p>With nine turns in a hundred steps it twists up the hills.</p>

<p>Clutching at Orion, passing the Well Star, I look up and
gasp. Then beating my breast sit and groan aloud.</p>

<p>I fear I shall never return from my westward wandering;
the way is steep and the rocks cannot be climbed.</p>

<p>Sometimes the voice of a bird calls among the ancient
trees&mdash;a male calling to its wife, up and down through the
woods. Sometimes a nightingale sings to the moon,
weary of empty hills.</p>

<p>It would be easier to climb to Heaven than to walk the
Szechwan Road; and those who hear the tale of it turn pale
with fear.</p>

<p>Between the hill-tops and the sky there is not a cubit’s
space. Withered pine-trees hang leaning over precipitous
walls.</p>

<p>Flying waterfalls and rolling torrents mingle their din.
Beating the cliffs and circling the rocks, they thunder in a
thousand valleys.</p>

<p>Alas! O traveller, why did you come to so fearful a
place? The Sword Gate is high and jagged. If one
man stood in the Pass, he could hold it against ten
thousand.</p>

<p>The guardian of the Pass leaps like a wolf on all who
are not his kinsmen.</p>

<p>In the daytime one hides from ravening tigers and in
the night from long serpents, that sharpen their fangs and
lick blood, slaying men like grass.</p>

<p>They say the Embroidered City is a pleasant place, but
I had rather be safe at home.</p>

<p>For it would be easier to climb to Heaven than to walk
the Szechwan Road.</p>

<p>I turn my body and gaze longingly towards the West.</p>

City, in Memory of Former Excursions</span></h3>

<p>Do you remember how once at Lo-yang, Tung Tsao-ch’in
built us a wine-tower south of the T’ien-ching Bridge?</p>

<p>With yellow gold and tallies of white jade we bought
songs and laughter, and we were drunk month after month,
with no thought of kings and princes, though among us
were the wisest and bravest within the Four Seas, and men
of high promotion.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>(But with you above all my heart was at no cross-purpose.)<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Going round mountains and skirting lakes was
as nothing to them. They poured out their hearts and
minds, and held nothing back.</p>

<p>Then I went off to Huai-nan to pluck the laurel-branches,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
and you stayed north of the Lo, sighing over thoughts and
dreams.</p>

<p>We could not endure separation. We sought each other
out and went on and on together, exploring the Fairy
Castle.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>We followed the thirty-six bends of the twisting waters,
and all along the streams a thousand different flowers were
in bloom. We passed through ten thousand valleys, and in
each we heard the voice of wind among the pines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the Governor of Han-tung came out to meet us, on
a silver saddle with tassels of gold that reached to the
ground. And the Initiate of Tzŭ-yang<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> summoned us,
blowing on his jade <i>shēng</i>. And Sennin music was made
in the tower of Ts’an Hsia,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> loud as the blended voices of
phœnix and roc.</p>

<p>And the Governor of Han-tung, because his long sleeves
would not keep still when the flutes called to him, rose and
drunkenly danced. Then he brought his embroidered coat
and covered me with it, and I slept with my head on
his lap.</p>

<p>At the feast our spirits had soared to the Nine Heavens,
but before evening we were scattered like stars or rain,
flying away over hills and rivers to the frontier of Ch’u. I
went back to my mountain to seek my old nest, and you,
too, went home, crossing the Wei Bridge.</p>

<p>Then your father, who was brave as leopard or tiger,
became Governor of Ping-chou<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and put down the rebel
bands. And in the fifth month he sent for me. I crossed
the T’ai-hang Mountains; and though it was hard going
on the Sheep’s Gut Hills, I paid no heed to broken
wheels.</p>

<p>When at last, far on into Winter, I got to the Northern
Capital,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> I was moved to see how much you cared for my

cups and fine foods on a blue jade dish. You made me
drunk and satisfied. I had no thought of returning.</p>

<p>Sometimes we went out towards the western corner of
the City, to where waters like green jade flow round the
temple of Shu Yü.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> We launched our boat and sported on
the stream, while flutes and drums sounded. The little
waves were like dragon-scales, and the sedge-leaves were
pale green. When it was our mood, we took girls with us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and gave ourselves to the moments that passed, forgetting
that it would soon be over, like willow-flowers or snow.
Rouged faces, flushed with drink, looked well in the sunset.
Clear water a hundred feet deep reflected the faces of the
singers&mdash;singing-girls delicate and graceful in the light of
the young moon. And the girls sang again and again to
make the gauze dresses dance. The clear wind blew the
songs away into the empty sky: the sound coiled in the air
like moving clouds in flight.</p>

<p>The pleasures of those times shall never again be met
with. I went West to offer up a Ballad of Tall Willows,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
but got no promotion at the Northern Gate and, white-headed,
went back to the Eastern Hills.</p>

<p>Once we met at the Southern end of Wei Bridge, but
scattered again to the north of the Tso Terrace.</p>

<p>And if you ask me how many are my regrets at this
parting, I will tell you they come from me thick as the
flowers that fall at Spring’s end.</p>

<p>But I cannot tell you all I feel; I could not even if I
went on talking for ever. So I call in the boy and make
him kneel here and tie this up, and send it to you, a
remembrance, from a thousand miles away.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Part of a Poem in Irregular Metre.</i>)</p>

<p>On through the night I flew, high over the Mirror Lake.
The lake-moon cast my shadow on the waves and travelled
with me to the stream of Shan. The Lord Hsieh’s<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
lodging-place was still there. The blue waters rippled;
the cry of the apes was shrill. I shod my feet with the
shoes of the Lord Hsieh and “climbed to Heaven on a
ladder of dark clouds.”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Half-way up, I saw the unrisen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
sun hiding behind the sea and heard the Cock of Heaven
crowing in the sky. By a thousand broken paths I twisted
and turned from crag to crag. My eyes grew dim. I
clutched at the rocks, and all was dark.</p>

<p>The roaring of bears and the singing of dragons echoed
amid the stones and streams. The darkness of deep woods
made me afraid. I trembled at the storied cliffs.</p>

<p>The clouds hung dark, as though they would rain; the
air was dim with the spray of rushing waters.</p>

<p>Lightning flashed: thunder roared. Peaks and ridges
tottered and broke. Suddenly the walls of the hollow
where I stood sundered with a crash, and I looked down on
a bottomless void of blue, where the sun and moon gleamed
on a terrace of silver and gold.</p>

<p>A host of Beings descended&mdash;Cloud-spirits, whose coats
were made of rainbow and the horses they rode on were
the winds.</p>

<h2>DISCUSSION ON THE FOREGOING PAPER</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The Chairman (Mr. George Jamieson)</span>: Mr. Li T’ai-po was, I am
afraid, a bit of a Bohemian (laughter), and his Bacchanalian experiences
have been repeated in later days even with the great poets. I am sure you
will all join with me in expressing a hearty vote of thanks to Mr. Waley for
his address and the very felicitous language in which he has translated a
number of these ancient poems. I trust his paper will be printed and preserved
with the rest of our publications, because these poems, as far as I can
judge&mdash;but hearing them read does not impress one so much as reading
them at leisure&mdash;are well worthy of careful perusal. It is curious to note
how unchangeable and immobile China is. At the time these poems were
written we in Great Britain were living under King Alfred and trying to
keep out the Danes and other things. (Laughter.) I can tell you that
the Szechwan Road as described in the poem that Mr. Waley has read is
just the same now as it was when the poem was written. And the social
conditions of the people are the same now as they were at that time. I
have often thought that Chinese poets are very limited in their range.
They seem to be deficient in the quality of imagination. China has never
produced a great epic poem. Of course I speak subject to correction, but
I believe I am right in saying that China has never produced a poet comparable
with Homer, Dante, Virgil, or Milton. There has been no one
born with the power of telling a story like Homer. The poets of China
appear to me to be emotional and descriptive, but incapable of any high
flights of imagination. I think that Macaulay says that great flights of
imagination are peculiar to the early periods of a nation’s civilization, and
that story-telling reaches its highest form as an art before printing has been
much in vogue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">M. F. A. Fraser</span>: I have listened to this lecture with the greatest
interest. The English was particularly pleasing, and I am glad that the
lecturer has broken away from the old custom of seeking rhymes, and
followed the French custom in the translation of these poems. A man
may be an excellent writer and translator, and not be a poet, but to
translate foreign poetry into English considerable literary gifts are required.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul King</span>: All of you who have been lately in China must be
struck with the extraordinary difference between the China described in
these poems and the China which has come into being since the revolution.
Ideas of a very practical nature have now taken possession of the people.
And then, what about modern Chinese poets? Do any of us know of
any? In my intercourse with the Chinese I cannot recall a modern
Chinese who was a poet. It is possible that I may have met one, and that
he concealed his poetic gifts. (Laughter.) Our lecturer tells us, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>ever,
that he knows certain Chinese poets. It would be interesting to
know if they are publishing their poems, and how they would compare
with the work of the older poets in our possession.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">L. Y. Chen</span>: I should like to join in congratulating Mr. Waley on
his very learned paper and beautiful translations. It is quite true that
there are no epic poems in Chinese literature. This form of poetry has
not been introduced in China, but I differ with your statement, Sir, that
Chinese poetry lacks imagination. (Applause.) I could give you many
instances to the contrary, though not from memory. The last speaker’s
remark that the present China is different from what China is in Chinese
poetry may be true, but I may well retort that the England as represented
in Shakespeare is very different from the England of to-day. (Laughter
and cheers.) And Li T’ai-po lived many hundred years ago, but
Shakespeare lived at a more recent period. Human nature has two states,
the spiritual and the practical. You can combine the two. If you have
the practical it does not necessarily follow that you are lacking in the
spiritual. As for present-day Chinese poets, there are several famous ones
in China.</p>

<p>Since the lecturer has raised the question whether Li T’ai-po or
Tu Fu is the greater poet, I would say that the Chinese of the present day
consider Tu Fu to be the greater. It strikes me as curious that European
people who know something about Chinese poetry should prefer Li T’ai-po.
Perhaps very few people have heard of Tu Fu. Certainly there is no
translation of the most important of Tu Fu’s poems in the English
language. In China every child who has studied poetry knows something
about Tu Fu’s poems. Tu Fu is placed first by the Chinese because he
is the greatest national poet. He expresses national feelings in a way
that can be appreciated by everybody. Li T’ai-po’s poems deal chiefly
with wine and women, love and sensual things, but Tu Fu’s poems are
full of men and women, elderly people and children, their joy, their
anguish, the hardship of the soldier, and things of that sort. In a word,
Tu Fu’s poetry expresses what we ordinary men and women wish to
express and cannot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">G. Willoughby-Meade</span>: One or two observations occur to me in
connection with the translation of this poetry into English. The two
greatest reading publics are the Anglo-American and the Chinese. The
Anglo-American people have produced an enormous amount of poetry
which they do not often quote, and the Chinese have produced an
enormous amount of poetry which, according to experts, they quote a great
deal. Now, at the present moment that peculiar British shyness for
quoting poetry seems to have largely disappeared in consequence of the
writings of soldier poets. These poems have been written under conditions
of great danger, difficulty, and discomfort, and it seems to me that it
would be a very good thing if poetry illustrating the thought of these men
could be placed before the Anglo-American public.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span> proposed a hearty vote of thanks to the Lecturer,
which was carried by acclamation.</p>
